Aileron is a high quality sans serif font designed by Sora Sagano. With the reference from the popular font [Helvetica][1], Mr. Sagano added his own touch to the design to make it more curvy and elegant. According to him, the design was close to Helvetica, but closer to [Univers][2] in terms of concept.
